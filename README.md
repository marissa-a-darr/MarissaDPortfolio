## Description <a name="description"></a>   
This application is designed to showcase my work to potential employers and collaborators interested in working with me. My past work can be viewed displaying application names, github links, and links leading to live demonstrations of the application. I have a short biography, a short resume, and languages and skills I have learned pertaining to Software Development. There is a contact page that will directly email me using the EmailJs software with their message.
